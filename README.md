## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app or any additional context you'd like to add.

Not much challenges besides getting used to building an app using Supabase since I'm more used to building CRUD applications with firebase. I've learned SQL before and have experience using backend services so that transition for this project wasn't too much of an issue.
